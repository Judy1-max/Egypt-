    <li class="Title">Pyramids</li>
    <p class="Text">One of the most mysterious Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (and the only one still standing) and One of the most attractive places in Egypt, the Pyramids of Giza—the Great Pyramid of Giza (Khufu Pyramid), Pyramid of Khafre, and Pyramid of Menkaure—still live up to more than 4,000 years of hype. Seeing these 4th-dynasty pyramids and their guardian Sphinx rising from the Giza Plateau is a must on any trip to Cairo (and the reason many travelers find themselves in Egypt),even Wonders of the World, and the 
        only one to survive, is the Great Pyramid 
        of Khufu and its neighbors on the Gizeh 
        Plateau just outside Cairo, Egypt.  
        Built by the Pharaoh Khufu in 
        2560 BC, it took great teems of 
        dedicated laborers over 20 years to haul 
        6 millions of tons of limestone into the 
        classic shape. The Pharaohs Khafre and 
        Menkau-Re that followed Khufu 
        attempted to duplicate this feat, but on 
        lesser scales.  
        The pyramids remain to this day a spectacular, and awe-inspiring example of ancient craftsmanship, but also a source of mystery

        <li class="Title">Valley of the king</li>
        <p>
            Valley of the Kings is a trove of archaeological wonders, containing dozens of tombs filled with art and hieroglyphics.

        <li class="Title">Hurghada Marina</li>
        <P>
            Opened in 2008, Hurghada Marina is the recreational hub of the Red Sea resort. Centered on a 200-berth harbour and bordered by the Marina Boulevard—a walkway flanked by palms, parks, and ochre-painted shops and residential blocks—the marina boasts an abundance of shopping, dining, and entertainment options.

        <li class="Title">Nile River</li>
        <P>
            Measuring a mighty 4,150 miles (6,680 kilometers) from end to end, the Nile is the longest river in the world. It's also the lifeblood of Egypt, flowing through the heart of the Sahara desert and passing through cities, including Khartoum, Aswan, Luxor, and Cairo, before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria.

        <li class="Title">Careless Reef</li>
        <P>
            The corals of Careless Reef, set in the open waters of the Red Sea about an hour from Hurghada, are flourishing again as it recovers from the crown-of-thorns seastar’s predation. With excellent visibility, shallow pinnacles, and a steep wall with caves and overhangs, it offers something for every diver, including the chance of big pelagics.
        </P>
        <li class="Title">Luxor Temple</li>
        <P>
            An ancient sanctuary surrounded by honking taxis, touts, and strolling families, Luxor Temple’s grandeur has endured more than 3,000 years on the East Bank of the Nile. Linked to Karnak Temple via the Avenue of Sphinxes, Luxor Temple boasts soaring colonnades, elaborate columns, statues, and images of Amenhotep III and Ramses II.

        <li class="Title">Ras Mohammed National Park</li>
        <P>
            On the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, Ras Mohammed National Park is home to Sharm el Sheikh’s best diving, notably Shark Reef, Yolanda Reef, and Jackfish Alley. Besides the pristine coral that awaits offshore, the land delivers empty beaches, rugged cliffs, and desert, plus mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and diverse birdlife.
