        <p class="Intro">Even though Egypt is one of the first countries in the Middle East to address the CE support as well to have education and training in this field, it is presently experiencing many challenges in supporting medical technologies and may even more than the countries described here. This is mainly due to the post-Arab spring, the instability of the region, the brain draining of many qualified clinical engineers to work in other countries and with most the recent depreciation of the Egyptian pound and with the severe shortage of hard currencies and financial resources in the country.

            On the regulatory part, this is done by Drug Policy and Planning Center of Ministry of Health, making sure all new technologies meet certain standards as required by the exporting countries which is a new trend compared to more than a decade ago
